# 🧾 Employee Biography System

A command-line Java application that allows users to create, update, and manage employee biographies efficiently. This project was developed based on the **Hill & Knowlton (H&K)** case study, which emphasizes the need for accurate and up-to-date employee information in a knowledge management system.

## 📌 Project Description

The Employee Biography System simulates a knowledge-sharing platform used within organizations to store and retrieve staff bios. It allows users to:
- Add new employee biographies
- Update existing employee data
- Validate required fields such as name, email, and phone number
- View and search biographies

This software was built with clean object-oriented design, following UML diagrams, and applying the **Command Design Pattern**. It also includes **Object Constraint Language (OCL)**-style validation and **JUnit** unit testing.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🧩 **Modular architecture** using the Command Pattern for flexible command execution
- 📘 **UML Modeling** including Use Case, Class Diagram, and Sequence Diagram
- ✅ **Input validation** for mandatory fields (name, email, phone)
- 🧪 **Automated unit tests** using JUnit
- 📝 **Manual test case documentation** for validating edge cases
- 💻 **Command-line interface** (CLI) for interaction
- 🧠 **Designed for knowledge-based systems** used in enterprise environments

## Case Study: Hill & Knowlton (H&K) Looks for a New Knowledge Management System.

H&K is a global public relations firm headquartered in New York City with 1,900 employees and 68 offices in 34 countries around the world. H&K had previously built an Intranet to facilitate the sharing and management of its project knowledge. H&K employees saw many problems with the existing system. Most important, however, they simply had little reason to use it. They indicated the data were out of date, inaccurate, and often irrelevant. For example, they noted that the staff biographies were quite outdated, even so far as to still contain biographies on former staff members who had left the company as much as two years earlier. Biographies are essential to H&K clients because they want to know the skills and experience of the H&K staff assigned to their accounts. H&K employees use biographies to help them identify someone with relevant experience that they can turn to for advice and help.
